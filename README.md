## Project Overview

This project provides a collection of SQL queries designed to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on healthcare datasets. These queries cover various aspects of patient demographics, hospital admissions, billing, medical conditions, and more. The aim is to generate insights into healthcare operations, patient management, and hospital performance.

## Key Features

- **Demographic Analysis**: Understand patient distribution by gender, age, and blood type.
- **Admissions Overview**: Analyze admission trends by hospital, month, and admission type (elective vs. emergency).
- **Medical Conditions**: Identify common conditions and their impact on hospital stay and billing.
- **Billing and Insurance**: Generate summaries of billing amounts and trends by insurance provider.
- **Doctor and Room Performance**: Evaluate the performance of doctors and hospital rooms based on patient outcomes and billing.

## Tools Used

- **SQL**: To run queries on the dataset and extract meaningful insights.
- **Power BI / Tableau**: For visualizing key insights and creating interactive dashboards.

## Getting Started

1. **Run SQL Queries**: Load the dataset into your preferred SQL database and run the provided queries.
2. **Visualize Results**: Use tools like Power BI or Tableau to build interactive dashboards based on the query outputs.

## Use Case Scenarios


- **Patient Management**: Segmenting patients based on demographics and medical conditions.
- **Financial Insights**: Understanding billing patterns and insurance claims.
- **Healthcare Overview**: Overview of operations in health-care with patient detail in depth.
